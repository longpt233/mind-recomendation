The core of NRMS is a news encoder and a user encoder. In the newsencoder, a multi-head self-attentions is used to learn news representations from news titles by modeling the interactions between words. In the user encoder, we learn representations of users from their browsed news and use multihead self-attention to capture the relatedness between the news. Besides, we apply additive\n","attention to learn more informative news and user representations by selecting important words and news.\n","\n","## Properties of NRMS:\n","- NRMS is a content-based neural news recommendation approach.\n","- It uses multi-self attention to learn news representations by modeling the iteractions between words and learn user representations by capturing the relationship between user browsed news.\n","- NRMS uses additive attentions to learn informative news and user representations by selecting important words and news.\n","\n","## Data format:\n","For quicker training and evaluaiton, we sample MINDdemo dataset of 5k users from [MIND small dataset](https://msnews.github.io/).
